Description
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation-in-part of a application entitled ï¿½Printing System,ï¿½ filed on Mar. 12, 1998, Ser. No. 09/041,211, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,511,163, issued on Jan. 28, 2003, which is herein incorporated by reference.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to jet printers, including jet printers for direct-to-plate printing systems.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Ink-jet printers operate by charging drops of ink with a charging electrode and guiding them to a print substrate through a high intensity electric field. Printers can modulate the charge on an ink drop by changing the charging electrode voltage to select whether each drop is to be printed or instead sent to a gutter. Printers may also adjust the charging voltage to compensate for aerodynamic effects and for the influence of the charge from adjacent drops. Some printers employ a technique known as ï¿½swathingï¿½ to continuously change the field and thereby direct drops from one or more stationary ink jets to different locations on the printing substrate, instead of moving a print head across the substrate.
Jet printing techniques are applicable to direct-to-plate printers. Such printers typically apply a printing fluid to a sheet of plate stock mounted on a drum. This fluid causes changes in the portions of the surface of the plate on which it is deposited. Although further processing of the plate may be necessary, the result is a printing plate that can serve to print large numbers of pages.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one general aspect, the invention features a jet printer that includes a drum constructed and adapted to receive a print substrate and a drum control interface having an output provided to a motor for rotating the drum. The printer also includes a print head with a first jet printing fluid source attached to a movable carriage and at least one deflection element located proximate an output trajectory of the first jet printing fluid source. The deflection element has a deflection axis in the direction of an axis of rotation of the drum. Further included are a carriage mechanism for moving the carriage in the direction of the axis of rotation of the drum, a swathing table, interleaving logic with an output provided to the print head, and a control circuit responsive to the swathing table and having an output provided to at least the one deflection element.
In preferred embodiments, the print head can further include a second jet printing fluid source attached to the carriage, with the interleaving logic being operative to provide interleaved portions of data to be printed by the first and second jet printing fluid sources. The interleaving logic can include horizontal and/or vertical interleaving logic. The printer can further include a processor portion operative to drive the printer to print half-tone images on a print substrate. The print substrate can be a printing plate. The deflection element can be a charging tunnel surrounding an output of the jet printing fluid source. The deflection element can be one of a pair of deflection electrodes. The swathing table can include a series of different firing order entries that define different deflection amounts for the deflection element, whereby the deflection element directs drops from the printing fluid source to a succession of different locations on the printing substrate.
In another general aspect, the invention features a method of jet printing that includes moving a first jet printing fluid source relative to a print substrate along the direction of an axis of rotation of a print substrate. A first drop of printing fluid from the jet printing fluid source is electromagnetically guided so that it lands on the print substrate at a first distance along the direction of the axis of rotation of the print substrate from the jet printing source and at a first distance along the direction of advance of the print substrate. A second drop of printing fluid from the jet printing fluid source is electromagnetically guided so that it lands on the print substrate at a second distance along the direction of the axis of rotation of the print substrate from the jet printing source, with the first and second distances being different The method also includes rotating the print substrate relative to the jet printing fluid source about the axis of rotation after the step of electromagnetically guiding a first drop to advance the print substrate, and depositing a third drop adjacent the first drop after the step of rotating and according to an interleaved print pattern.
In preferred embodiments, the step of depositing can include depositing the third drop by a second jet printing fluid source between the-first and second drops in the direction of the axis of rotation of the print substrate. The step of depositing can include depositing the third drop by the first jet printing fluid source between the first and second drops in the direction of the axis of rotation of the print substrate, with the deposition of the first and third drops being separated in time by at least about a full revolution of the drum. The step of depositing can include depositing the third drop adjacent the first drop by a second jet printing fluid source at a second distance along the direction of advance of the print substrate, with the first and second distances along the direction of advance of the print substrate being different. The step of depositing can include depositing the third drop adjacent the first drop by the first jet printing fluid source at a second distance along the direction of advance of the print substrate, with the first and second distances along the direction of advance of the print substrate being different, and with the deposition of the first and third drops being separated in time by at least about a full revolution of the drum. The steps of moving, guiding, rotating, and depositing can form a part of a half-tone printing process and/or can be performed using a printing plate as a substrate.
In a further general aspect, the invention features a jet printer that includes means for moving a jet printing fluid source relative to a print substrate along a direction of an axis of rotation of a print substrate, means for rotating the print substrate relative to the jet printing fluid source about the axis of rotation to advance the print substrate, means for electromagnetically guiding a first drop of printing fluid from the jet printing fluid source so that it lands on the print substrate at a first distance along the direction of the axis of rotation of the print substrate from the jet printing source and at a first distance along the direction of advance of the print substrate, and for electromagnetically guiding a second drop of printing fluid from the jet printing fluid source so that it lands on the print substrate at a second distance along the direction of the axis of rotation of the print substrate from the jet printing source, wherein the second distance is different from the first distance, and means for causing a third drop to be deposited adjacent the first drop after the drum has rotated and according to an interleaved print pattern.
In preferred embodiments, the means for causing can include means for causing the third drop to be deposited by a second jet printing fluid source between the first and second distances in the direction of the axis of rotation of the print substrate. The means for causing can include means for causing the third drop to be deposited by the first jet printing fluid source between the first and second drops in the direction of the axis of rotation of the print substrate, with the deposition of the first and third drops being separated in time by at least about a full revolution of the drum. The means for causing can include means for causing the third drop to be deposited adjacent the first drop by a second jet printing fluid source at a second distance along the direction of advance of the print substrate, with the first and second distances along the direction of advance of the print substrate being different. The means for causing can include means for causing the third drop to be deposited adjacent the first drop by the first jet printing fluid source at a second distance along the direction of advance of the print substrate, with the first and second distances along the direction of advance of the print substrate being different, and with the deposition of the first and third drops being separated in time by at least about a full revolution of the drum. The printer can include means for driving the printer to print half-tone images on a print substrate. The print substrate can be a printing plate.
Systems according to the invention can be advantageous in that they provide an inexpensive, accurate and flexible method of controlling the trajectory of drops of printing fluid in jet printing. By treating drops as samples in a sampled-data system, printers can perform swathing, aerodynamic compensation, and adjacent drop compensation in the digital domain using an existing printer control processor or an inexpensive add-on microprocessor. Such printers can also be reconfigured for different printing applications without requiring a redesigned analog circuit, and they may even be digitally calibrated at start-up or on-the-fly to improve print characteristics. These features can improve the quality of printing, and can reduce the cost and time involved in developing improved printers.
Systems according to the invention may also permit printing operations to take place more quickly and efficiently, in moving-head, direct-to-plate, jet printers. Swathing can permit such printers to deposit individual charged drops that are spaced apart in two polar dimensions on a plate as it rotates. And interleaving can increase drop spacing as well. This allows for fine-pitch printing at high speeds with a minimum number of guard drops.

FIG. 2 is a flow chart illustrating the operation of the printer of FIG. 1; and

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT A jet printer 10 according to the invention includes a print substrate feed mechanism 12, a print head assembly 14, and a control circuit 16. The feed mechanism includes a print drum 30, which supports a print substrate 32, such as a piece of paper print stock or a printing plate. A motor 34 drives the drum 30 via a coupling mechanism 36.
The print head assembly 14 includes a print head that includes one or more nozzle assemblies 20 . . . 20 N each having a charging electrode 22 . . . 22N, such as a charging tunnel, at its output. A pair of deflection electrodes (e.g., 24, 26) is located on opposite sides of the path that a drop takes when exiting the nozzle. The deflection electrodes, the charging tunnel, and the nozzle assembly are all mounted on a carriage 29 driven by a carriage actuator 28. The carriage actuator is operative to move the carriage along a path that is parallel to the axis of rotation of the drum.
The control circuit 16 includes a print control processor 40 that can include interleaving logic 41 and has a control output provided to a drum control interface 42. The print control processor also has a data port operatively connected to a data port of a storage element 44, and a data port operatively connected to a digital filter 46. The digital filter has an output provided to a digital input of a digital-to-analog converter 48, which has an analog output provided to an input of a high-voltage amplifier 50. The amplifier has an output that is operatively connected to the charging electrode 22. Also provided is a high-voltage source 27 that can be controlled by the print control processor 40 and that has an output operatively connected to one of the deflection electrodes 26. The other deflection electrode 24 can be operatively connected to a fixed voltage source, such as ground.
FIG. 1 is intended as a general illustration of a printer according to the invention, and one of skill in the art would be able to modify its design in a number of ways while still obtaining benefits from the invention for different applications. For example, a number of different mechanisms can be used for the carriage actuator such as toothed-belt or lead-screw mechanisms. And while a drum-based feed mechanism 12 is appropriate for printing directly on lithographic plates, other printing applications may employ different kinds of mechanisms, such as continuous feed paper on a platten.
Features and functionality of the various circuit elements shown in FIG. 1 can also be combined in different ways. For example, the print control processor 40 can incorporate control routines that control the motor 34, allowing a signal from the print control processor or a simple buffered version of that signal to drive the motor. This eliminates the need for a dedicated hardware drum control circuit 42, which receives only a simple on/off signal from the print control processor. The print control processor can be located inside the printer, or it can be located remote from the printer and communicate with the printer, such as via serial cable.
Note that it is also possible to apply the invention to different types of deflection configurations by modulating the excitation provided to one or more of its deflection elements. For example, it is possible to modulate the voltage on the deflection electrodes 24, 26 instead of, or in addition to, modulating the voltage on the charging electrode 22. In addition, it is also possible to operate a jet printer without a charging electrode and modulate only a voltage on one or more deflection electrodes. It is also possible to modulate other approaches to guiding a drop, such as by modulating a magnetic field instead of an electric field.
In operation, referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, operation of the jet printer 10 begins with operator set-up of the printer and a software start command (step 60). In the case of a direct-to-plate printer that prints on aluminum or plastic plates, an operator first mounts a fresh plate 32 on the printer's drum 30. The operator then causes a host system to download data representing the material to be printed into the print control processor 40. The print control processor can also download coefficients into the digital filter 46, or run a calibration routine to derive these coefficients, if these are not stored locally. Calibration can be performed by depositing printing fluid drops on a calibration needle and adjusting the filter coefficients until an optimal transfer function has been reached. The processor can then instruct the drum control interface 42 to start the motor 34, which causes the drum 30 to rotate.
After the drum is up to speed, the print control processor 40 instructs the nozzle assembly 20 to generate a series of charged printing fluid drops, which pass through the charging electrode 22 and then between the deflection electrodes 24, 26. The magnitude of the voltage to be applied to the charging electrode 22 by the amplifier 50 depends on whether and where each particular drop is to be printed (step 62). If a drop is not to be printed, such as in the case of a guard drop, the print control processor 40 will select a gutter or knife edge 23 as the destination for the drop (step 66). The print control processor will then compute an appropriate voltage to be applied to the charging electrode given the voltage between the deflection electrodes, to guide the drop into the gutter (step 68). Typically, this voltage is either the maximum or minimum voltage that the amplifier is configured to provide.
If the drop is to be printed, the print control processor 40 retrieves a drop position entry from a swathing table, which can be stored in the storage 44 (step 64). The entries in the swathing table are designed to cause successive, but non-adjacently deposited, drops to be separated from each other on the plate radially due to rotation of the drum and longitudinally due to the swathing. Because the drops are spaced in this way in these two polar dimensions, they will not touch each other. This is particularly important in half-tone printing, where only single, separate drops are deposited. Of course, the order in which the print data is sent to the print head must take the swathing sequence into consideration.
Superimposed on the swathing voltage is a voltage derived by the digital filter 46, which compensates for aerodynamic effects and for the influence of the charge on adjacent drops. The digital filter can be an Infinite-Impulse-Response (IIR) filter implemented using a digital signal processor, such as the TMS 320C203 integrated circuit available from Texas Instruments. The filter function implemented is:
OUT(n)=B 0*IN(n)+B 1*IN(nâ1)+B 2*IN(nâ3)+A 1*OUT(nâ1)+A 2*OUT(nâ2) Coefficients used in the function for one embodiment are:

In a system that has sufficient computational capacity, it is contemplated that further coefficients could be included in this function. Digital filter design is discussed in, for example, ï¿½Digital Signal Processing,ï¿½ Chapter 5, Alan VanOppenheim and Ronald W. Schafer, Prentice-Hall Inc. (1975), which in herein incorporated by reference.
Table 2 illustrates the operation of the digital filter for the initial drops to be printed in a print job. As can be seen from this table, charge interaction between drops and aerodynamic effects cause the filter voltage required to place the drop at a desired position to change from drop to drop.

Once the charging voltage has been computed, the digital filter supplies a code corresponding to that voltage to the digital-to-analog converter 48. The digital-to-analog converter converts this code into an analog voltage, which it presents on its analog output. The amplifier 50 then amplifies the analog voltage to a high level, which is applied to the charging electrode 22 (step 70).
When a final drop has been sent (step 72), the printer can be powered down, or a new print operation can begin (step 74). If drops remain to be printed, the process of determining a charging electrode voltage begins again for the next drop (step 62).
In one particular embodiment, a printer employs a continuous jet head that has multiple jet assemblies and employs swathed bitmap capability to print up to 16 rasters per revolution per channel in a helical progression about the drum. This high resolution bitmap capability allows every drop to be used on halftone images without any of them merging.
It has been empirically determined that 1200 dots per inch (DPI) can be accomplished using a 10 um nozzle at jet velocity of 50 m/s printing a 16 pixel wide swath with a firing order of: 0, 8, 4, 12, 1, 9, 5, 13, 2, 10, 6, 14, 3, 11, 7, 15. This order is stored as a series of charge values in a 32-entry swathing table that also has an entry for non-printing drops, although other types of swathing tables can be used as well. The separation on the individual charges corresponds to a voltage of approximately 4 volts. This requires a total voltage swing of about 128 volts on the charging electrode. A nominal separation of 64 volts between printed and non-printed drops provides sufficient separation for the knife edge to operate properly.
The deflection voltage on the nozzle assemblies is programmable by software from 0 to 2200 Volts, and the deflection voltages for each nozzle assembly are to be sensed individually. Stimulation is common for all nozzle assemblies and is a square wave with an amplitude that can be controlled from 2.5 to 41 Volts. The charging voltage output has 1024 discrete levels between ï¿½35 and â115 Volts with a settling time of 125 ns.
Referring to FIG. 3, it is advantageous to combine interleaving and swathing in printers according to the invention. In such a system, a print head that includes a series of jets spaced along the direction of rotation of the drum simultaneously prints in parallel swathed helical progressions with offset rasters. This combination of swathing and interleaving allows for fast printing and a high degree of separation of the deposited ink drops.
An illustrative printing sequence is shown in FIG. 3 for a printer with two nozzles that and each employ three-channel swathing, and that are interleaved with each other and with themselves. In this example, a first nozzle deposits its ink drops at equally spaced intervals during a first revolution. During a second revolution, the first nozzle again deposits its ink drops at equally spaced intervals, but places them between the drops deposited during the first revolution.
At the same time, a second nozzle is also depositing its ink drops at equally spaced intervals, but these are offset from the positions used by the first channel, such that they fall in the gaps left by the first nozzle. The result is an interleaved printing sequence where adjacent drops from one jet are printed on different revolutions, and where these drops are also separated by adjacent drops from another jet.
In the illustrated horizontally interleaved print progression, a first jet deposits a first drop A0 in a first stripe Î±0. It then deposits a second drop A1 in a third stripe Î±2. Finally, it deposits a third drop A3 in a fifth stripe Î±4. This pattern begins again as the print head advances with respect to the substrate while printing in even-numbered stripes.
During the same pass of the print head, a second jet is depositing a second swath, at a different position along the direction of rotation of the drum. This second swath begins when the second jet deposits a first drop B0 in a first offset stripe Î²1. It then deposits a second drop B1 in a third offset stripe Î²2. Finally, it deposits a third drop B2 in a fifth offset stripe Î²4. This pattern begins again as the print head advances with respect to the substrate while printing in even-numbered offset stripes.
During the same pass of the next revolution, the first jet will fill in remaining gaps by depositing drops in the odd-numbered stripes (i.e., Î±1, Î±3, etc.). Similarly, the second jet will fill in remaining gaps by depositing drops in the odd-numbered offset stripes (i.e., Î²1, Î²3, etc.).
The illustrated print order employs horizontal interleaving to separate drops in the direction of the axis of rotation of the drum. This effect can also be accomplished in the direction of rotation of the drum by performing vertical interleaving, in which adjacent print lines are deposited on different passes or even different rotations of the drum. And both horizontal and vertical interleaving can be performed by just a single jet, by interleaving over multiple passes and/or rotations.
For the purpose of clear illustration, the example shown in FIG. 3 employs a left-to-right firing order. It is also advantageous to combine interleaving and jumbled swathing order, however, to achieve a high degree of spacing between drops, and to avoid the creation of Moirï¿½ patterns. In one embodiment, it is believed that satisfactory 2400 DPI printing can be accomplished using the interleaving presented in connection with FIG. 3 and a 15-drop swath width. The firing order for this embodiment is 1, 8, 4, 13, 0, 6, 10, 3, 14, 7, 11, 2, 9, 5, 12. By appropriate selection of the type of interleaving and the number of swathing and interleaving channels, printing speed and resolution can be optimized for the deposition characteristics of a particular print head, ink, and substrate combination. Preferably, the carriage and drum are advanced continuously to achieve a smooth and precise helical progression, allowing for high precision deposition of ink drops.
The interleaving can be implemented using interleaving logic that directs appropriate pixels to the interleaved jets. This logic can be implemented in a number of ways, including by the use of dedicated logic circuitry, look-up tables, or software running on a processor, such as a print control processor for a multi-source print head. The logic can be separate from the logic implementing the swathing table, or the two functions may be implemented with some overlap.

Description
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to a novel class of fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers and compositions comprising the prepolymers used in the manufacture of medical devices. More specifically, the present invention relates to fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers having siloxane groups and hydrophilic groups derived from a reactive oligomer of hydrophilic monomers. The prepolymers are useful in making surface modified medical devices such as contact lenses.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Medical devices such as ophthalmic lenses made from silicone-containing materials have been investigated for a number of years. Such materials can generally be sub-divided into two major classes, namely hydrogels and non-hydrogels. Non-hydrogels do not absorb appreciable amounts of water, whereas hydrogels can absorb and retain water in an equilibrium state. Hydrogels generally have water content between about 15 to about 80 weight percent. Regardless of their water content, both non-hydrogel and hydrogel silicone medical devices tend to have relatively hydrophobic, non-wettable surfaces that have a high affinity for lipids. This problem is of particular concern with contact lenses.
Fumarate- and fumaramide-containing monomers and compositions comprising the monomers have been developed to make highly oxygen permeable hydrogels which may be used to make biomedical devices including contact lenses. Examples of these fumarate- and fumaramide-containing monomers and compositions can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,374,662, 5,420,324, and 5,496,871, the contents of each being incorporated by reference herein. Because of the polar character of amide functionality, this class of monomer shows good compatibility with both hydrophobic monomers such as tris(trimethylsiloxy)silane (TRIS) and hydrophilic monomers such as N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA). These prior art prepolymers give silicone hydrogels with excellent oxygen permeability and mechanical properties. However, like other silicone hydrogels, they are not wettable enough to be useful as continuous wear lenses unless the surface is treated.
Surface structure and composition determine many of the physical properties and ultimate uses of solid materials. Characteristics such as wetting, friction, and adhesion or lubricity are largely influenced by surface characteristics. The alteration of surface characteristics is of special significance in biotechnical applications where biocompatibility is of particular concern. Therefore, those skilled in the art have long recognized the need for rendering the surface of contact lenses and other medical devices hydrophilic or more hydrophilic. Increasing the hydrophilicity of the contact-lens surface improves the wettability of the contact lenses with tear fluid in the eye. This in turn improves the wear comfort of the contact lenses. In the case of continuous-wear lenses, the surface is especially important. The surface of a continuous-wear lens must be designed not only for comfort, but to avoid adverse reactions such as corneal edema, inflammation, or lymphocyte infiltration. Improved methods have accordingly been sought for modifying the surfaces of contact lenses, particularly high-Dk (highly oxygen permeable) lenses designed for continuous (overnight) wear.
Various patents disclose the attachment of hydrophilic or otherwise biocompatible polymeric chains to the surface of a contact lens in order to render the lens more biocompatible. For example, U.S. Pat. Pub. No. US 2002/0102415 A1 teaches plasma treatment of a fumarate- or fumaramide-containing substrate followed by reaction with other polymers, such as DMA/VDMO copolymer. U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/728,531 and 10/728,711 teach fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers having reactive functionality provided by residues having at least one reactive functional group.
Although manufacturing steps such as plasma treatment provide lenses having suitable coatings, it would be desirable to provide prepolymers having desirable surface activity to produce a surface treated lens without the need for plasma treatment or corona discharge treatment.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, a novel class of fumaric- and itaconic-prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups are disclosed for use with both silicone and non-silicone containing polymeric systems used for biomedical devices, especially contact lenses. The novel prepolymers have the following schematic representations:
YCOï¿½CHâCHCOW(R1)(SiR2R3O)m(SiR2R3)(R1)WOCCHâCHï¿½COY,CH2âC(CH2COY)COW(R1)(SiR2R3O)m(SiR2R3)(R1)WOC(CH2COY)CâCH2 andCH2âC(CH2COY)COW(R1)(SiR2R3O)m(SiR2R3)(R1)WOCCH2(COY)CâCH2 wherein R1 is an alkyl diradical that may have ether linkages, R2 and R3 are independently alkyl or phenyl groups, unsubstituted or substituted with halogen and ether linkages, W is O or NH, m is an integer between 2 and 200, and Y is a residue derived from a reactive oligomer of hydrophilic monomers. This reactive oligomer can be prepared by radical polymerization of a hydrophilic monomer/comonomer in an organic solution which also contains a quantitative amount of an amino or hydroxy-containing chain transfer agent so that the molecular weight of the oligomer can be maintained at a level suitable for making a prepolymer of this invention for a targeted application.
The invention is further directed toward hydrogels formed of a polymerizable mix comprising the novel class of fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups. Such hydrogels are useful in forming medical devices.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As stated above, the present invention is directed toward a novel class of fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups, useful in copolymerizable polymeric systems used for biomedical devices, especially contact lenses. As used herein, fumaric refers to a derivative of fumaric acid and can be a fumarate (an ester), a fumaramide (an amide) or a residue having both ester and amide functionalities. The fumaric group is a residue of trans-1,2-ethylenedicarboxylate. Therefore, it will be understood that the diastereoisomer of fumarate, maleate, is also intended to be included in the fumaric-containing prepolymers of the present invention. Itaconic refers to derivatives of itaconic acid and has a similar meaning as that of fumaric. In further embodiments of the present invention, the novel prepolymers are used to make biomedical devices and are useful in contact lens formulations which may be either ï¿½softï¿½ or ï¿½hardï¿½ and which may preferably be hydrogels.
As is known in the field, certain crosslinked polymeric materials may be polymerized to form a hard, water-free, xerogel. Xerogels are understood to be unhydrated hydrogel formulations. It was found that such xerogels could be physically altered to, for example, impart optical properties through machining, and then be hydrated and retain their water content.
When the term ï¿½polymerizationï¿½ is used herein we refer to the polymerization of the double bonds of the monomers and prepolymers endcapped with polymerizable unsaturated groups which results in a crosslinked three-dimensional network.
Further, notations such as ï¿½(meth)acrylateï¿½ or ï¿½(meth)acrylamideï¿½ are used herein to denote optional methyl substitution. Thus, for example, (meth)acrylate includes both acrylate and methacrylate and N-alkyl-(meth)acrylamide includes both N-alkyl acrylamide and N-alkyl methacrylamide.
The term ï¿½prepolymerï¿½ denotes a high molecular weight monomer containing polymerizable groups. The monomers added to the monomeric mixture of the present invention may therefore be low molecular weight monomers or prepolymers. Thus, it is understood that a term such as ï¿½silicone-containing monomersï¿½ includes ï¿½silicone-containing prepolymersï¿½.
The terms ï¿½shaped articles for use in biomedical applicationsï¿½ or ï¿½biomedical devices or materialsï¿½ or ï¿½biocompatible materialsï¿½ mean the hydrogel materials disclosed herein have physicochemical properties rendering them suitable for prolonged contact with living tissue, blood and the mucous membranes.
While the present invention contemplates the use of a novel class of fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups for medical devices including both ï¿½hardï¿½ and ï¿½softï¿½ contact lenses, the formulations containing the novel class of fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups of the present invention are thought to be especially useful as soft hydrogel contact lenses. As is understood in the field, a lens is considered to be ï¿½softï¿½ if it can be folded back upon itself without breaking while in the fully hydrated state.
A hydrogel is a hydrated cross-linked polymeric system that contains water in an equilibrium state. Silicone hydrogels (i.e., hydrogels containing silicone) are usually prepared by polymerizing a mixture containing at least one silicone-containing monomer and at least one hydrophilic monomer. By the term silicone, it is meant that the material is an organic polymer comprising at least five percent by weight silicone (ï¿½OSi-linkages), preferably about 10 to about 95 percent by weight silicone, more preferably about 30 to about 90 percent by weight silicone. Applicable silicone-containing monomeric units for use in the formation of silicone hydrogels are well known in the art and numerous examples are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,136,250; 4,153,641; 4,740,533; 5,034,461; 5,070,215; 5,260,000; 5,310,779; and 5,358,995.
The novel classes of fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups of the present invention have at least one fumaric or itaconic group. Monomer mixes comprising the novel prepolymers of the present invention may comprise both thermal- and photo-initiators for curing purposes. The monomer mixes may further comprise at least one additional hydrophilic monomer. Further, the monomer mix may additionally comprise at least one silicone-containing monomer.
The fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers of the present invention are prepared according to syntheses well known in the art and according to the examples disclosed herein. The novel class of fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups of the present invention are incorporated into the monomer mix. The relative weight % of the novel class of fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups as compared to the total monomer mix weight % is from about 10% to about 80%, more preferably from about 10% to about 50%, and most preferably about 15% to about 40%.
Examples of hydrophilic monomers include, but are not limited to, amide, hydroxy or zwitterionic containing hydrophilic monomers such as ethylenically unsaturated lactam-containing monomers including N-vinyl pyrrolidinone; methacrylic and acrylic acids; (meth)acrylic substituted alcohols, such as 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), 2-hydroxyethylacrylate, glycerol methacrylate and polyethylene-glycol monomethacrylate; and (meth)acrylamides, such as methacrylamide and N, N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA); vinyl carbonate or vinyl carbamate monomers such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,215, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference; oxazolinone monomers such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,910,277, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference and hydrophilic zwitterionic monomers such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,743,878, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Preferred hydrophilic vinyl-containing monomers that may be incorporated into the hydrogels of the present invention include monomers such as N-vinyl lactams such as N-vinyl pyrrolidinone (NVP), N-vinyl-N-methyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-ethyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-ethyl formamide, N-vinyl formamide, with NVP being the most preferred.
Preferred hydrophilic acrylic-containing monomers which may be incorporated into the hydrogel of the present invention include hydrophilic monomers such as N, N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, glycerol methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylamide, methacrylic acid and acrylic acid, with DMA being the most preferred. Other suitable hydrophilic monomers will be apparent to one skilled in the art. The relative weight % of hydrophilic monomer(s) to total weight % of the comonomer mix is preferably from about 5% to about 80%, more preferably from about 20% to about 70%, and most preferably about 20% to about 40%.
As mentioned previously, additional silicone-containing monomers may be present in the monomer mixes with the novel class of fumaric- or itaconic-containing monomers. One preferred class of suitable silicone-containing monomers which may be incorporated into a monomer mix with the novel class of fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups of the present invention are the bulky polysiloxanylalkyl (meth)acrylic monomers represented by the following Formula (I):
wherein: X is O or NR; each R15 is independently hydrogen or an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms; and each R16 is independently a lower alkyl or phenyl group; and f is 1 or 3 to 10.
Such bulky monomers include methacryloxypropyl tris(trimethylsiloxy)silane(TRIS), pentamethyldisiloxanylmethylmethacrylate, tris(trimethylsiloxy)methacryloxy propylsilane, phenyltetramethyldisiloxanylethyl acrylate, and methyidi(trimethylsiloxy)methacryloxymethyl silane. Further preferred classes of silicone-containing monomers which may be incorporated into a monomer mix with the reactive functionalized fumaric- or itaconic-containing monomers of the present invention are the poly(organosiloxane) monomers represented by the following formula (II):
wherein: A is an activated unsaturated group, such as an ester or amide of an acrylic or a methacrylic acid; each R23-R26 is independently selected from the group consisting of a monovalent hydrocarbon radical or a halogen substituted monovalent hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 18 carbon atoms which may have ether linkages between carbon atoms; R27 is a divalent hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 22 carbon atoms; and n is 0 or an integer greater than or equal to 1. When siloxane-containing monomers, other than our novel silicone containing prepolymers, are incorporated into the monomer mix, the weight % of the other siloxane-containing monomers as compared to the total monomer mix weight % is from about 5% to about 60%, more preferably from about 10% to about 50%, and most preferably about 10% to about 40%.
Either the silicone-containing monomer, the novel class of fumaric- or itaconic-containing prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups, or the hydrophilic monomer may function as a crosslinking agent (a crosslinker), the crosslinking agent being defined as a monomer having multiple polymerizable functionalities. Additional crosslinkers also may be present in the monomer mix which polymerizes to form the hydrogel.
Many commonly used crosslinking agents are hydrophobic. When it is desirable for both an acrylic-containing monomer and a vinyl-containing monomer to be incorporated into the silicone-containing polymer of the present invention, because these vinyl- and acrylic-containing monomers have differing reactivity ratios and may not copolymerize efficiently, a further crosslinking agent having both a vinyl and an acrylic polymerizable group may be used. Such crosslinkers which facilitate the copolymerization of these monomers are the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 5,310,779, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Such crosslinkers are represented by the following schematic representation:
wherein V denotes a vinyl-containing group having the formula:
A denotes an acrylic-containing group having the formula:
S denotes a styrene-containing group having the formula:
wherein R31 is an alkyl radical derived from substituted and unsubstituted hydrocarbons, polyalkylene oxide, poly(perfluoro) alkylene oxide, dialkyl-capped polydimethylsiloxane, dialkyl-capped polydimethylsiloxane modified with fluoroalkyl or fluoroether groups; R32-R40 are independently H, or alkyl of 1 to 5 carbon atoms; Q is an organic group containing aromatic moieties having 6-30 carbon atoms; X, Y, and Z are independently O, NH or S; v is 1, or higher; and a, s are independently greater than or equal to 0; and a+s is greater than or equal to 1. An example is 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate vinyl carbonate or carbamate.
Other crosslinking agents which may be incorporated into the silicone-containing hydrogel of the present invention include polyvinyl, typically di- or tri-vinyl monomers, most commonly the di- or tri(meth)acrylates of dihydric ethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, butylene glycol, hexane-1,6-diol, thio-diethylene glycol-diacrylate and methacrylate; neopentyl glycol diacrylate; trimethylolpropane triacrylate and the like; N,Nâ²-dihydroxyethylene-bisacrylamide and -bismethacrylamides; also diallyl compounds like diallyl phthalate and triallyl cyanurate; divinylbenzene; ethylene glycol divinyl ether; and the (meth)acrylate esters of polyols such as triethanolamine, glycerol, pentaerythritol, butylene glycol, mannitol, and sorbitol. Further examples include N, N-methylene-bis-(meth)acrylamide, sulfonated divinylbenzene, and divinylsulfone. Also useful are the reaction products of hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates with unsaturated isocyanates, for example the reaction product of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate with 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate (IEM). See U.S. Pat. No. 4,954,587.
Other known crosslinking agents are polyether-bisurethane-dimethacrylates (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,192,827), and those crosslinkers obtained by reaction of polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and polytetramethylene glycol with 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate (IEM) or m-isopropenyl-Î³,Î³-dimethylbenzyl isocyanates (m-TMI), and polysiloxane-bisurethane-dimethacrylates. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,486,577 and 4,605,712. Still other known crosslinking agents are the reaction products of polyvinyl alcohol, ethoxylated polyvinyl alcohol or of polyvinyl alcohol-co-ethylene with 0.1 to 10 mol % vinyl isocyanates like IEM or m-TMI.
The prepolymers of the present invention, when copolymerized, are readily cured to cast shapes by methods such as UV polymerization, use of free radical thermal initiators and heat, or combinations thereof. Representative free radical thermal polymerization initiators are organic peroxides, such as for example acetyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, decanoyl peroxide, stearoyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, tertiary butyl peroxypivalate, peroxydicarbonate, and the commercially available thermal initiators such as LUPERSOLï¿½ 256, 225 (Atofina Chemicals, Philadelphia, Pa.) and the like, employed in a concentration of about 0.01 to about 2% by weight of the total monomer mixture. Representative UV initiators are those known in the field such as, benzoin methyl ether, benzoin ethyl ether, DAROCURï¿½-1173, 1164, 2273, 1116, 2959, 3331, IGRACUREï¿½ 651 and 184 (Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Ardsley, N.Y.).
In addition to the above-mentioned polymerization initiators, the copolymer of the present invention may also include other components as will be apparent to one skilled in the art. For example, the monomer mix may include additional colorants, or UV-absorbing agents and toughening agents such as those known in the contact lens art.
The resulting copolymers of this invention can be formed into contact lenses by the spincasting processes such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,408,429 and 3,496,254, static casting processes such as in U.S. Pat. No. 5,271,875 and other conventional methods, such as compression molding as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,084,459 and 4,197,266.
Polymerization of the monomer mix may be conducted either in a spinning mold, or a stationary mold corresponding to a desired contact lens shape. The thus-obtained contact lens may be further subjected to a mechanical finishing, as occasion demands. Also, the polymerization may be conducted in an appropriate mold or vessel to give a lens material in the form of button, plate or rod, which may then be processed (e.g., cut or polished via lathe or laser) to give a contact lens having a desired shape.
The hydrogels produced by the present invention are oxygen transporting, hydrolytically stable, biologically inert, and transparent. The monomers and prepolymers employed in accordance with this invention are readily polymerized to form three-dimensional networks which permit the transport of oxygen and are optically clear, strong and hydrophilic.
The present invention provides materials which can be usefully employed for the fabrication of prostheses such as heart valves and intraocular lenses, as optical contact lenses or as films. More particularly, the present invention concerns contact lenses.
The present invention further provides articles of manufacture which can be used for biomedical devices, such as, surgical devices, controlled drug delivery devices, heart valves, vessel substitutes, intrauterine devices, membranes and other films, diaphragms, surgical implants, blood vessels, artificial ureters, artificial breast tissue and membranes intended to come into contact with body fluid outside of the body, e.g., membranes for kidney dialysis and heart/lung machines and the like, catheters, mouth guards, denture liners, intraocular devices and especially contact lenses.
It is known that blood, for example, is readily and rapidly damaged when it comes into contact with artificial surfaces. The design of a synthetic surface which is antithrombogenic and nonhemolytic to blood is necessary for prostheses and devices used with blood.
Although the teachings of the present invention are preferably applied to soft or foldable contact lenses or like medical devices formed of a foldable or compressible material, the same may also be applied to harder, less flexible, materials such as lenses formed of a relatively rigid material such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA).
In one embodiment of the present invention, the novel class of fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups are used to produce a contact lens.
The novel class of fumaric- and itaconic-containing prepolymers with both siloxane and hydrophilic groups useful in certain embodiments of the present invention may be prepared according to syntheses well known in the art and according to the methods disclosed in the following examples.
EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of Reactive Oligomer Derived from N-vinylpyrrolidone To a thoroughly dried 1000-mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser, Nitrogen inlet, was charged with N-vinylpyrrolidone (100 g., 0.8997 mole), 2-mercaptoethanol (12.6 mL, 0.1796 mole), 400 mL anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and Vazo-64 (1.14 gram). The contents, while stirred at room temperature, were bubbled with nitrogen for about 15 minutes. The contents were then heated to reflux for 48 hours. NMR indicated some vinyl groups remaining. Then 0.5 grams of Vazo-64 was added and the contents were continued to be heated to reflux for an additional 4 days. Only a trace amount of vinyl groups remained. The solution was then condensed to 120 mL and then poured into 1200 mL of ether to precipitate the product. The product was dissolved/precipitated twice. The final product was a white powder.
The molecular weight of the oligomer product was determined by acid-base titration. It was first allowed to react with an excess amount of phenyl isocyanate, then with excess amount of dibutylamine, both in THF, followed by titrating with standardized 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. The molecular weight as determined was 416. (Theoretical 623)
Example 2 Preparation of Î±,Ï-Bi-hydroxybutyl-terminated Polydimethylsiloxane (Mn 1376) A 100-mL 4-neck round bottom flask was charged with 1,3-bis-hydroxybutyltetramethyldisiloxane (76.8 g, 0.273 mole), dimethoxyethyldimethylsilane (542 g, 4.51 moles). While mechanically stirring, through a dropping funnel, 297 mL conc. HCl and 81 grams (4.51 mole) of water was added into the flask over 30 minutes. The content of the flask (contents) was then heated with oil bath at 80ï¿½ C. for one hour. The methanol was distilled off (total 318 mL of methanol collected over a period of 5 hours). Then, 159 mL of water and 15 mL of conc. HCl was added to the flask, the contents being refluxed at about 100-110ï¿½ C. for 4 hours.
The content was cooled down and extracted with 300 mL of ether. The ether solution was extracted with 200 mL of water. After that, the ether solution was washed two times with 200 mL of 5% of Sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution, then three times with 200 mL of water each. The crude product was then dropped into a 25/75 by weight mix of methanol/water (712 grams) in a conical flask while mixed with a stirrer.
The mixture was poured into a separatory funnel. The bottom layer was removed and the top layer collected. To the top layer was added 100 mL ether and anhydrous magnesium sulfate and stirred overnight. The contents were then filtered with a celite pad. The ether solvent was then stripped off using a rotavapor and the residue was further stripped under high vacuum (0.025 mmHg) at about 80-90ï¿½ C. for 5 hours to give the final purified product. SEC data showed Mn of 1375, Mw of 2980.
Example 3 Preparation of NVP Oligomer-Terminated Fumarate Prepolymer of Polydimethylsiloxane To a thoroughly dried 500-mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser was added bis-Î±,Ï-hydroxybutyl polydimethylsiloxane (Mn 1376, 55.02 grams, 0.0399 mole) and fumaryl chloride (15.4 grams, 0.10 moles). The mixture was heated with an oil bath at about 70ï¿½ C. under nitrogen blanket. After two hours, the reaction was complete and the contents of the flask (contents) was stripped under vacuum (5-6 mmHg) at about 80ï¿½ C. for 2 hours.
The IR spectrum showed two kinds of peaks for carbonyl groupsï¿½both acid chloride and ester. To the contents was then added 16.64 g (0.04 mole) of the reactive NVP oligomer of Example 1 and 100 mL of methylene chloride. The content was heated under reflux until all acid chloride group was disappeared totally (by IR 1769 cmâ1) (2 hours). Then the mixture was cooled. 5.41 grams of sodium bicarbonate was added to neutralize the content while stirring overnight.
Added 600 mL of methylene chloride. Then filtered the solution and extracted it with 100 mL of water. The organic layer was separated and the solvent was stripped to give a yellowish viscous fluid product.
Example 4 Preparation of Hydrogel Films Containing the Fumarate-containing Prepolymer and Other Comonomers (UV Curing) A monomer mix consisting of the prepolymer as described in Example 3, 35 parts (all parts by weight), 3-methacryloxypropyl tris(trimethylsiloxy)silane (TRIS), 35 parts, N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) 30 parts; Hexanol, 40 parts and Darocur-1173, 0.3 parts was prepared. The mix was filtered through a 1.2 micron filter. The mix was then cast between two silane-treated glass plates and cured under UV for 2 hours. After extracting the released film in ethanol overnight, the dried films were saturated in buffered saline to give hydrogel films with water content of 41.3%, modulus 76.9 g/mm2, elongation 59% and tear strength 3.0 g/mm.
Comparative Example 1 A comparable formulation derived from a fumarate-containing prepolymer end capped with t-butylamine and other components of the same weight ratio provided in Example 4 gave a hydrogel with a water content of 24% and a modulus of 97 g/mm2.
Example 5 Preparation of Reactive Oligomer Derived from N,N-dimethylacrylamide To a thoroughly dried 1000-mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser, Nitrogen inlet, was charged N,N dimethylacrylamide (140.05 g), 2-mercaptoethanol (19.8 ml), 450 mL anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and Vazo-64 (1.8247 gram). The contents, while stirred at room temperature, were bubbled with nitrogen for about 15 minutes. The contents were then heated to reflux for 48 hours. IR indicated no vinyl groups present. The solution was then condensed to 120 mL and then poured into 1200 mL of ether to precipitate the product. The product was dissolved/precipitated twice. The final product was a gum. The molecular weight of the oligomer product was determined by acid-base titration. It was first allowed to react with an excess amount of phenyl isocyanate, then with excess amount of dibutylamine, both in THF, followed by titrating with standardized 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. The molecular weight as determined was 731. SEC: Mn=993, Mw=2673.
Example 6 Preparation of DMA Oligomer-terminated Fumarate Prepolymer of Polydimethylsiloxane To a thoroughly dried 500-mL round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser was added bis-Î±,Ï-hydroxybutyl polydimethylsiloxane (Mn 1388, 26.6 grams) and fumaryl chloride (2.86 grams). The mixture was heated with an oil bath at about 70-75ï¿½ C. under nitrogen blanket. After two hours, the reaction was complete and the contents of the flask (contents) were stripped under vacuum (1-2 mmHg) at about 80ï¿½ C. for 2 hours. The temperature was then lowered to about 50ï¿½ C. and 27.75 g of the reactive DMA oligomer of Example 5 and 125 mL of methylene were added. The contents were heated under reflux until all acid chloride group disappeared totally (by IR 1769 cmâ1). Then the mixture was cooled. Sodium bicarbonate was added to neutralize the contents while stirring overnight. 600 mL of methylene chloride was added to the neutralized contents. The solution was filtered and extracted with 100 mL of water. The organic layer was separated and the solvent was stripped to give a gummy solid product.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION Briefly, the present invention in its broadest form includes a plurality of light sources arranged in a chosen pattern around a video display terminal and adapted to automatically provide a sequenced pattern at selected intervals.
Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Identical or similar structure will be identified with identical callouts. FIG. 1 is a schematic representation of a perspective view of an embodiment of the eyestrain and fatigue relief apparatus of the present invention adapted to be mounted on a video display terminal as a unit. Light sources 10a-e are moveably mounted on frame 12 which is mounted by support 16 to video display terminal 14. Power source 18 provides energy to the light sources at chosen intervals in selected sequenced patterns. It should be mentioned that any number of light sources in various configurations on the frame may be utilized for a given application. Moreover, power source 18 may be operated from an ac source or from battery power, dependent upon the power usage of the lamps employed. User 20 is distracted from the substantially planar, two-dimensional surface 22 of video display terminal 14 automatically, at preselected intervals for chosen time periods. It is anticipated that, generally, 2-5 minute time periods of stimulation occurring approximately every hour will provide the desired relief from eyestrain and fatigue for the user. However, different individuals, different working environments, and different times of the workday may dictate refinements of this regimen. The colors and shapes of the light emitters within light sources 10 may be changed from time to time in order to maintain user interest. Hinges 24a,b in frame 12 permit the dimensions of the array to be changed in order to alter the depth and peripheral focus for the eyes.
FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a second embodiment of the present apparatus adapted to be mounted on a video display terminal as a unit, showing an alternate mounting arrangement. Light source 10a is shown to have several individual light generators 26a-e, each having a different pattern. Similarly, for light sources 10b and 10c. Supports 16a and 16b are reversibly and adjustably attached to video display terminal 14. One convenient manner in which to accomplish this task would be to employ fastening tape consisting of opposing pieces of fabric, one with a dense arrangement of tiny nylon hooks, and the other with a dense nylon pile, that interlock when pressed together, and commonly available under the Tradename Velcro. Power source 18, shown in FIG. 1 hereof, might be located within one of the light source modules and provide the power and timing for all of the light sources employed. Light source 28 is shown extending from light source 10b in the event that it is desirable to extend the dimensions of the overall array. A slot 30 for a second such a light source is shown in light source 10c.
FIG. 3 is a schematic representation of a system embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention illustrating a plurality of cooperating light sources adapted to be removably attached to a video display terminal as separate units, forming selected patterns. Power source 18 supplies energy and timing sequence information through electrical connections 32a-f to light sources 10a-e located around the periphery of the front of video display terminal 14. Again, the light sources may have various colors and shapes which may be changed from time-to-time in order to maintain user interest. Hinges 34a,b permit light sources 10a and 10d to be moved forward and backward in order to provide a three-dimensional aspect to the system.
FIG. 4 is a schematic representation of a perspective view the system embodiment of cooperating light sources shown in FIG. 3 hereof, illustrating light sources located independently of the video display terminal in order to increase the peripheral and depth dimensions of the system, and suitable for achieving numerous three-dimensional patterns. Power source 18 supplies energy and timing sequence information to light sources 10a and 10b which are mounted on video display terminal 14 and to external light sources 36a,b which may be moved around to provide variations in the three-dimensional configuration. It should be mentioned that the light sources should be placed well within the maximum vertical and horizontal viewing angles of the eyes of the user in order to provide a continuous directing influence thereon.
FIG. 5 is a schematic representation of the front view of a flat frame embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention adapted to be mounted on a video display terminal, the flat frame being suitable for use with the external components shown in FIG. 4 hereof in order to achieve a third dimension. Frame 38 supports light sources 10a-d, and external components 36 illustrated in FIG. 4 hereof may be electrically connected thereto in order to provide three-dimensional configurations.
The foregoing description of several preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. For example optical fibers and light emitting diodes may be used in place of incandescent tight sources in order to permit batteries to be utilized instead of conventional ac electric power sources. Additionally, the present invention may be used to relieve eyestrain and fatigue due to other causes, such as reading. In this situation, the light sources might be deployed in a three-dimensional array which would include the use of a table and a wall, in one embodiment. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and form a part of the specification, illustrate four general embodiments of the present invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to relief of eyestrain and fatigue and, more particularly, to an apparatus for generating sequenced light patterns in three-dimensions which when followed by the eyes of a user thereof provide eye exercise resulting in relief of eye strain and fatigue.
It is well known that extended use of video display terminals (VDTs) is a cause of eye fatigue and strain for the user. See, for example, "Video Display Terminal Health Hazards #1," Fact Sheet, from the Occupational Health and Safety Bureau of the New Mexico Environment Department, Santa Fe, N. Mex. 87502. It is also well known that performing eye exercises relieves some of the symptoms of eye strain and fatigue. See, for example, "Video Display Terminal Health Hazards #1," supra, where it is suggested that in addition to rest breaks, eyes may be rested by looking up or at long distances. Moreover, Computers and Visual Stress: How to Enhance Visual Comfort While Using Computers, by E. G. Godnig and J. S. Hacunda, Seacoast Information Services, Charlestown, R.I. (1990), states that staring for extended periods at a flat, two dimensional display, provides little visual relief and may not provide enough eye stimulation to maintain proper focus.
Although there are several products presently commercially available which provide moving light displays for stimulating eye movement, some in color, for claimed relief of stress as well, they are all substantially planar. Causing the eyes to follow three-dimensional patterns, however, exercises and thereby strengthens many of the eye muscles involved in the vision process.
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for generating sequenced, three-dimensional light patterns for eye exercises.
Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for generating sequenced, three-dimensional light patterns for eye exercises having a multiplicity of colors and patterns in order to maintain interest in the user thereof.
Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION To achieve the foregoing and other objects and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the apparatus for relieving eyestrain and fatigue resulting from extended of video display terminals hereof may include a plurality of light sources removably attached to the video display terminal and forming a three-dimensional array having a chosen configuration, and means for establishing a chosen sequenced light pattern in the plurality of light sources; whereby a user's eyes are distracted from the video display terminal at chosen intervals, and may follow the light pattern established in the light sources, thereby receiving beneficial exercise.
Preferably, the light sources have chosen colors and shapes which may be changed to maintain user interest.
It is also preferred that the light sources are caused to automatically cycle through their chosen flashing pattern at the chosen intervals.
Benefits and advantages of the present invention include automatic distraction of a user at selected intervals from the substantially two-dimensional surface of the video display terminal for chosen time periods in order to permit the eyes to recover from the strain of focusing thereon using apparatus which is readily adaptable to all video display terminals.

Oct 5, 2012 MADRID â Spain on Friday called up 24-year-old Javi Martinez to stand in for injured defender Gerard Pique in their upcoming World Cup qualifying matches against France and Belarus.Coach Vicente del Bosque also left Chelsea star forward Juan Mata out of the squad, which includes his club teammate Fernando Torres and Barcelona's David Villa among its strike force.Pique injured his left foot during Barcelona's 3-2 victory over Spartak Moscow in the Champions League on September 19.He has not ruled out returning to action in Sunday's league clash against Madrid, but Del Bosque left him out of the national squad for the games against Belarus in Minsk on October 12 and France in Madrid on October 16."I don't know whether Pique will play on Sunday, but he has not trained a single day (since his injury) and I didn't think it suitable to call him up," Del Bosque said.Martinez, 24, joined Bayern Munich this season from Athletic Bilbao for 40 million euros ($50 million) -- the most expensive signing ever in the German league.He was part of the triumphant Spain squad that won this year's Euro 2012 championship.Del Bosque noted Martinez's ability to switch from a central defensive role to that of a defensive midfielder."With Javi Martinez we have two alternatives," he said. "We will use him where we think most appropriate. I called him up as a defender but that doesn't mean anything."World Champions Spain will be without another Barcelona defender, Carles Puyol, who is sidelined for eight weeks after dislocating his elbow during his club's 0-2 Champions League victory over Benfica on Tuesday.SquadGoalkeepers: Iker Casillas (Real Madrid), Victor Valdes (Barcelona), Pepe Reina (Liverpool/ENG)Defenders: Alvaro Arbeloa (Real Madrid), Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Raul Albiol (Real Madrid), Javi Martinez (Bayern Munich/GER), Ignacio Monreal (Malaga), Jordi Alba (Barcelona), Juanfran (Atletico Madrid)Midfielders: Cesc Fabregas (Barcelona), Andres Iniesta (Barcelona), David Silva (Manchester City/ENG), Sergio Busquets (Barcelona), Xavi Hernandez (Barcelona), Xabi Alonso (Real Madrid), Benat Etxebarria (Real Betis), Santiago Cazorla (Arsenal/ENG)Forwards: Pedro (Barcelona), David Villa (Barcelona), Fernando Torres (Chelsea/ENG), Roberto Soldado (Valencia), Jesus Navas (Sevilla)
